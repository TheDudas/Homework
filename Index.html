    <!-- My fun Website that I built from scratch or maybe I just copied from Bootstrap?  -->
<h2>Welcome to the John's PC Service website.</h2>  <!-- added Headers to emphasize website introduction. -->
  <h3>We hope you like what you see and will contact us for any questions. We offer many services for your Computer needs. </h3> <!-- brief text of what the site is about.-->
  <p>John's PC Service was established to help local people with their computer needs. We do not have computer certifications or any high status accomplishments. 
    We have only completed a few computer courses and have a desire to learn more.</p> <!-- paragraphs for a different look, too plain. -->

<!-- created an unordered list to just list a bunch of junk about what some repair places really do but don't tell you -->
    <ul class="promise"> 
      <li>Yes, we will charge you to learn on your equipment.</li> 
      <li>If that doesn't work for you, find another store. </li>
      <li>There are no refunds and change is not given. We only accept $20's, $50's, and $100's.</li> 
      <li>Only good credit cards are accepted. No funky empty ones.</li>
      <li>Why should you trust us?  Don't! </li>
      <li>We will take your money and maybe fix your computer, maybe not....</li>
    </ul>
    


<!-- created a container to list some of the services a company would offer.  These aren't bad, but I liked the card options better. -->
